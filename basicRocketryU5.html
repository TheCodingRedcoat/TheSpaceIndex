        <h2>Propulsion is the generation of force by pushing or pulling to modify the motion of an object.</h2>
        
        <h2 class="unit1Part1">Part 1: Liquid Propulsion</h2>
        <h2 class="part1">
            In rockets, propulsion is usually generated by mixing oxidiser and fuel in the combustion chamber in an engine and throwing it out,
            generation propulsion. Since space has no atmosphere, rockets have to carry both fuel and oxidizers.<br><br>
            Oxisider is a chemical that is needed to make fuel burn. <br>
            Oxidiser is commonly Liquid oxygen (Oxigen but cooled down until it becomes a liquid). <br><br>
            Fuel is usually anything combustiable, and a liquid, which is usually highly refined kerosene (RP-1). <br><br>
            In summary, engines are the place where fuel and oxidiser is combusted, sent out through the nossle, creating propulstion.<br>
        </h2>

        <h2 class="unit1Part2">Part 2: Solid Propulsion</h2>
        <h2 class="part2">
            Solid propulsion is the combustion of solid fuel. <br><br>
            Solid propulsion technology is often used for a launcher's boosters or main stage to enable a launcher to lift off. <br><br>
            At present, a solid rocket booster (SRB)is usually made up of a steel case containing blocks of a self-burning mixture called solid propellant. <br><br>
            When this burns the gases produced are forced through a nozzle to provide the power for liftoff. <br><br>
            Solid rocket boosters (SRBs) are used on rockets such as the Space Launch System (SLS).<br><br>
            SRBs could not be turned off after ignition, and SRBs are cheaper than liquid propulsion methods.

            And that is the important stuff about propulsion. <br>
