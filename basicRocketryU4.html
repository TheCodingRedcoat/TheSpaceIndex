        <header><h1>Unit 4: Newton's 2nd Law<h1></header>

        <h2>
            The 2nd law relates force, acceleration, and mass. The law is often written as the equation: <br><br>
            <span style="font-size: 50px;">f = ma</span><br><br>
            The force or thrust produced by a rocket engine is directly proportional to the mass of the gas and particles produced by burning rocket propellant times the acceleration of those combustion products out the back of the engine. 
            This law only applies to what is actually traveling out of the engine at the moment and not the mass of the rocket propellant contained in the rocket that will be consumed later. <br><br>
            The implication of this law for rocketry is that the more propellant (m) you consume at any moment and the greater the acceleration (a)of the combustion products out of the nozzle, the greater the thrust (f).
