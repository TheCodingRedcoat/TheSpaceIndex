        <h2>
            Newton's First Law states that objects at rest remain at rest and objects in motion remain in motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. <br><br>
            This law is sometimes referred to as Galileo's law of because Galileo discovered the principle of inertia. <br>
            This law simply points out that an object at rest, such as a rocket on a launch pad, needs the exertion of an unbalanced force to cause it to lift off. <br><br>
            The amount of the thrust (force) produced by the rocket engines has to be greater than the force of gravity holding it down. <br>
            As long as the thrust of the engines continues, the rocket accelerates. <br><br>
            When the rocket runs out of propellant, the forces become unbalanced again. <br>
            This time, gravity takes over and causes the rocket to fall back to Earth. <br>
            Following its landing in multiple pieces, the rocket is at rest again, and the forces are in balance.

        <h2>
            The imteresting part of this law that has enormous implications for spaceflight. <br>
            When a rocket reaches space, atmospheric drag (friction) is greatly reduced or eliminated. <br><br>
            Within the atmosphere, drag is an important unbalancing force. <br>
            That force is virtually absent in space. A rocket traveling away from Earth at a speed greater than 11.186 kilometers per second (6.95 miles per second) or 40,270 kph (25,023 mph) (Earth's escape velocity) will eventually escape Earth's gravity. <br>
            It will slow down, but Earth's gravity will never slow it down enough to cause it to fall back to Earth. <br><br>
            Ultimately, the rocket (actually its payload) will travel to interplanetary space , or depending on the speed, the stars with additional rocket thrust will be needed. <br>
            Its inertia will cause it to continue to travel outward.
