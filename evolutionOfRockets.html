            One of the first devices to successfully employ the principles essential to rocket flight was a wooden bird. <br>
            The writings of Aulus Gellius, a Roman, tell somewhere around the year 400 B.C., a Greek named Archytas mystified and amused the citizens of Tarentum, now part of southern Italy by flying a pigeon made of wood. 
            Escaping steam propelled the bird suspended on wires. The pigeon used the action-reaction principle, which was not stated as a scientific law until the 17th century.<br><br>
            About three hundred years after the pigeon, another Greek, Hero of Alexandria, invented a similar rocket-like device called an aeolipile. It too used steam as a propulsive gas. 
            Hero mounted a sphere on top of a water kettle. A fire below the kettle turned the water into steam, and the gas traveled through pipes to the sphere. 
            Two L-shaped tubes on opposite sides of the sphere allowed the gas to escape, and in doing so gave a thrust to the sphere that caused it to rotate. <br>
