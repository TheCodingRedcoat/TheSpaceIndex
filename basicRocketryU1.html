        <h2>The word "rocket" can mean different things. <br>
            Most people think of a tall, thin, round vehicle that launches into space. <br><br>
            According to <a href="https://www.wordnik.com/words/rocket" target="_blank">Wordnik</a>, a rocket is 
            "any flying device propelled by the reactive force of hot gases expelled in the direction opposite its motion. 
            The fuel used to generate the expelled gases in rockets may be solid or liquid; rockets propelled by liquid fuels typically have a combustible fuel (such as hydrogen or kerosene) which is combined inside the rocket engine with an oxidizer, such as liquid oxygen. 
            Single liquid fuels (called monopropellants) are also known. Since rocket engines do not depend on a surrounding fluid medium to generate their thrust, as do airplanes with propellers or jet engines, they may be used for propulsion in the vacuum of space."
