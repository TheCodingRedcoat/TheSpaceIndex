        <h2>
            Newton's 3rd Law is the principle of action and reaction. <br><br>
            In the case of rockets, the action is the force produced by the expulsion of gas, smoke, and flames from the nozzle end of a rocket engine. <br>
            The reaction force propels the rocket in the opposite direction. <br><br>

        <h2>    
            When a rocket lifts off, the combustion products from the burning propellants accelerate rapidly out of the engine. <br><br>
            The rocket, on the other hand, slowly accelerates skyward. 
            It would appear that something is wrong here if the action and reaction are supposed to be equal. 
            They are equal, but the mass of the gas, smoke, and flames being propelled by the engine is much less than the mass of the rocket being propelled in the opposite direction. <br>
            Even though the force is equal on both, the effects are different. <br><br>
            Newton's first law explains why. 
            The law states that it takes a force to change the motion of an object. The greater the mass, the greater the force required to move it.
